## 📌 Key Insights

- 📉 **Sales & Profit Fluctuate Seasonally**: High sales months don’t always translate into high profits, indicating margin differences.
- 💸 **Discount-heavy categories (e.g., Tables)** underperform in profit despite solid sales.
- 🌍 **The West Region** generates the highest profit overall; Central has volume but thinner margins.
- 📦 **Phones, Chairs, and Binders** consistently rank in the top-selling sub-categories.

## 🧪 Time-Series Analysis

Sales and profit were aggregated monthly to understand long-term trends and evaluate the health of the business across fiscal periods. The results were visualized using line plots, rolling averages, and seasonal patterns.
